        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bread, the most simple carbohydrate of all time, however there isn't just one type of bread, <em>types vary</em>. <br>
            Bread can range from wholegrain, wholemeal, white, spelt, rice, sourdough, etc. the list goes on and on... <br>
            <strong>But since the dawn of time we have been consuming bread</strong>, mostly because wheat can grow in such harsh conditions compared <br>
            to numerous other crops. This recipe will be a simple run down on how to create white bread.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 teaspoons of instant yeast</li>
                <li>.75 cup of warm water & 2.6 cup of warm water (divided)</li>
                <li>52g of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of salt</li>
                <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>9 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>LessDoit</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In the bowl of a mixer, dissolve yeast in ¾ cup (180ml) of warm water and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2⅔ cups (640ml) water, sugar, salt, room temperature butter, and 5 cups of flour. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Using a dough hook, mix on low speed, gradually adding remaining flour until dough is soft and tacky, but not sticky. Knead until a soft ball forms and clears the sides of the bowl, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turn to coat, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a draft-free place until doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface, press to remove air pockets, and divide in two.</li>
        <li>For each piece, pat into a 9x12-inch rectangle, roll tightly from the short end into a cylinder, pinch seams and ends to seal, tuck ends, and place into greased 9-inch loaf pans.</li>
        <li>Cover loaves loosely and let rise in a draft-free area until doubled, about 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Position an oven rack on the lowest setting and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Brush loaves with melted butter and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating halfway, until golden brown (internal temperature should read 195°F).</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, brush with more melted butter, cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely before slicing.</li>
        <li>Store bread in an airtight bag or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 1 month.</li>
            </ol>
